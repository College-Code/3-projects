<h1>Here's a list of things I don't like when coding</h1>

<ol>
<li>Writing HTML code with indents</li>
<li>When the code doesn't work and I don't know why</li>
<li>Using Windows, or pretty much anything Microsoft</li>
</ol>

<h2>God I hate when I can't find a bug...</h2>
<p>I hate bugs and Microsoft is like a bug, it's discusting, hard to work around, and needs to be killed immediately.</p>
