<h1>Here's a list of things I like doing when I'm coding</h1>

<ol>
<li>Writing code in my own style</li>
<li>Thinking of cool and random ideas</li>
<li>I get a huge rush of dopamine when I solve a problem that took hours sometimes</li>
</ol>

<h2>What is my own style of writing code?</h2>
<p>Well it's a little odd but I like writing HTML code with no indents, for some reason my brain has an easier way to find things without than with idk why</p>

<p>Here's what this page used to look like for example</p>

<h3>I also write CSS a little different, here's what that looks like:</h3>

<p>Notice how it's all in one line instead of indented as well. Fun fact this is also 500+ lines of code not indented, yay for me!</p>

<h4>These are things I like doing, You can either see what I don't like now or go back to the home page</h4>
