<h1>Here's kinda like a wall of fame of my projects and also a website of almost everything I've built</h1>

<h2>So ya, if you want, you can actually see all of my sites I have planned and have running!</h2>
<p>It's all on <a href="https://aremysiteslive.com" target="_blank">Aremysiteslive.com</a></p>
<p>I built this page with a flask/python backend so it's a little slow sometimes but it's mostly accurate.</p>
<p>also sorry, ignore any swear words you may encounter this was a personal project lol</p>


<h3>You can view my Raspberry Pi used to run my sites in the <a href="tools.html">Tools</a> Section</h3>
<h3>Here is a short wall of fame for cool pages I've built</h3>

<img src="catgirl.png" alt="Image of thecatgirlcompany website" id="catgirl">
<p>#1, the catgirl company looking great</p>

<img src="poomanpeebird.png" alt="Image of the poomanpeebird website" id="poomanpeebird">
<p>#2, poomanpeebird being my first site released publicly</p>

<img src="tacocat.png" alt="Image of the one and only tacocat website" id="tacocat">
<p>#3, also taco cat because he's a cool guy and one of the pages used to practice when I was learning this stuff.</p>

<h4>That concludes this part of the assighment until I add CSS soon so it looks nice and cool</h4>
<p>Also checked the W3C and it's all good</p>
